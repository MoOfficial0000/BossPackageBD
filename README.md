## Installation

### 1 — Important Notes

1. **You must have a special called "Boss" in your dex** - This is for rewarding the winner. Make it so the special's end date is the 1st of January 1970 and has a rarity of 0.

2. **Only use a countryball as a boss** if it has both the collectible and wild cards stored, otherwise this will result in an error. Cards without wild cards do not work as a boss. If you are using a ball made from the admin panel for the boss, then it's fine, since admin panel requires wild card.

3. You may change the shiny buffs in the code to suit your dex better - it's defaulted at 1000 HP & 1000 ATK.
