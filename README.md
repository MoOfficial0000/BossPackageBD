## Installation

### 1 — Important Notes

1. **You must have a special called "Boss" in your dex** - This is for rewarding the winner. Make it so the special's end date is 1970. Rarity must be 0.

2. **Only use a countryball as a boss** if it has both the collectible and wild cards stored, otherwise this will result in an error. Cards without wild cards do not work as a boss. If you are using a ball made from the admin panel for the boss, then it's fine, since admin panel requires wild card.

3. You may change the shiny buffs in the code to suit your dex better - it's defaulted at 1000 HP & 1000 ATK.

### 2 — Configure extra.toml

**If the file doesn't exist:** Create a new file `extra.toml` in your `config` folder under the BallsDex directory.

**If you already have other packages installed:** Simply add the following configuration to your existing `extra.toml` file. Each package is defined by a `[[ballsdex.packages]]` section, so you can have multiple packages installed.

Add the following configuration:

```toml
[[ballsdex.packages]]
location = "git+https://github.com/MoOfficial0000/BossPackageBD.git"
path = "boss"
enabled = true
editable = false
```

**Example of multiple packages:**

```toml
# First package
[[ballsdex.packages]]
location = "git+https://github.com/example/other-package.git"
path = "other"
enabled = true
editable = false

# Boss Package
[[ballsdex.packages]]
location = "git+https://github.com/MoOfficial0000/BossPackageBD.git"
path = "boss"
enabled = true
editable = false
```

### 3 — Rebuild and start the bot

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

This will install the package and start the bot.
